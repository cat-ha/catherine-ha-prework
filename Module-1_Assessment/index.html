                    <p>Hello, my name is Catherine and I recently graduated from the University of Minnesota—Twin Cities with a bachelor's in Computer Science. In addition, I minored in Neuroscience as I've always had a passion for the medical field. Throughout the time I spent at the University of Minnesota, I got heavily involved with two student groups: The Society of Asian Scientists & Engineers (SASE) and College of Science & Engineering International Ambasssadors (CSEIA). Through these two organizations, I've grown tremendously in terms of leadership. I cannot be more thankful to my friends and family who supported me all the way here today.</p>

                    <p>Let me share a few of my hobbies. I am passionate about baking although I still consider myself an amuteur. I love catching up on my shows and different dramas in my free time. I enjoy hanging with family and friends though hanging with friends this summer seems impossible with the whole COVID-19 situation. As a foodie, I enjoy eating out with friends whenever I get the chance; oh how I miss that.</p><br>
                    <p>As for future aspirations, I do hope to someday pursue a Master's degree. Though I am unclear of which programs to apply to as of now. Guess I'll see!</p>
